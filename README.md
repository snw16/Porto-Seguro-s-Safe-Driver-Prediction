# Porto-Seguro‘s-Safe-Driver-Prediction
Driving Towards Safety: XGBoost-Enhanced Prediction of Safe Drivers
Predicting the likelihood of safe driving behavior using the Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction dataset.

📌 Highlights
Dataset Size: ~1 million+ records, 57 anonymized features.

Objective: Classify driver insurance claims to assist insurers in identifying potential risks.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost), Power BI, Imbalanced-learn.

🛠️ Approach
Data Preprocessing: Built a comprehensive abnormal and missing data handling system aligned with business requirements.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Utilized advanced resampling techniques like Borderline-SMOTE and SMOTE-ENN for improved class balance.

Feature Engineering: Engineered feature interactions, selected key predictors, and reduced dimensionality from 57 → 30 features.

Modeling: Developed and optimized an XGBoost classifier, achieving a normalized Gini score of 0.285 on the validation set.

Visualization & Reporting: Generated interactive reports in Power BI for presenting project outcomes and business implications.

Collaboration: Worked in a cross-functional academic setting with professors and peers to align technical execution with project goals.

📊 Results
Normalized Gini Score: 0.28 (Validation Set)

Outcome: Provided actionable insights for risk assessment in driver safety prediction.
